The Star project is a simple demonstration of FEAT that evolves a graph structure
resembling a 7-point star when the nodes of the genome are laid out sequentially
on a circle.  It's a trivial problem, but it demonstrates the usage of FEAT's
default functionality.  

FEAT is augmented with customizations of the Node and IOrganismEvaluator classes.  
Of the two, only an custom evaluator is *required* to run a FEAT experiment.  The
package "org.gatech.feat.experiments.star" contains the customizations, and this
fact is indicated in experiment-parameters.properties by the property
feat.customizations.package.

The Star projects supports two ways in which a FEAT experiment can be run (which
makes the project structure a little confusing).  Method (2) is recommended for
most cases!!!

(1) Run with experiment JAR from "core" directory.
	- This is similar to the XOR project.  Just run the "build.xml" file 
	  and a JAR will be packaged and placed in dist/.  That JAR can then
	  be used when executing from the "core" project, where it will be
	  unpacked into experiment/.  The JAR is built from the customization
	  classes in bin/, and the experiment artifacts in experiment/.
	  
(2) Run directly from the Star project. 
	- Most users should use this strategy.  IT DOES NOT INVOLVE A
	  JAR INTERMEDIATE.  Everything needed to run is already in the
	  experiment directory, and FEAT is initialized without a JAR.  The
	  "TestStar" unit test in testsrc demonstrates how to do this. 
	  
Other notes:

(1) The test case in the Star project has a cute little UI that shows you 
	the state of the most fit organism updated each epoch.  The nodes are
	layed out radially so that the "Star" will be apparent, and each node
	is color coded by the number of correct outgoing links it has.  Each
	should have two, so 2 = GREEN, 1 = YELLOW and anything else = RED.
