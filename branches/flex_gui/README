++ =======================================================================
++ BrainFarm: Java implementation of the NEAT algorithm.
++ Based on Ugo Vierucci's Java port of Ken Stanley's original c++ code.
++ =======================================================================

IMPORTANT! - You must build brainfarm from the command line at least once
before setting up Eclipse. This will ensure that all the dependencies 
amongst the sub-projects are built before you define them in Eclipse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
++ BUILDING BRAINFARM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BrainFarm uses Ant and Antennae to make setting up and building as simple
as possible.

1. Define User-Specific Build Properties

A template build properties file has been provided to help.

Copy the user-build.properties.template and rename it user-build.properties.
Change the values of the properties in this file to match your system's setup.

2. Build

Open a terminal window (mac) or command prompt (win) and type

ant build

This will create the output directories for the sub-projects and build the
binaries for each of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
++ SETTING UP ECLIPSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eclipse project files are provided for all the brainfarm sub-projects.

Open Eclipse and select the workspace you want to import the brainfarm 
projects into.

Right-Click in the 'Project Explorer' window.
Select 'Import'.
In the Import dialog window select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
Click 'Next'
Hit the 'Browse' button and navigate to the brainfarm directory.
Click 'OK'

You should now see all the brainfarm sub-projects listed

Click 'Finish' and they'll be imported into your workspace. These projects will
show problems though, as they're missing dependencies.

Now you need to define a User Library so Eclipse knows where the library jars
are that brainfarm needs to link to.

Open the Eclipse Preferences 

Window->Preferences (win)
Eclipse->Preferences (mac)

In the list panel on the left select

Java->Build Path->User Libraries

In the User Library panel that opens on the left select 'New'

Give your new User Library the name

BRAINFARM_LIB

click 'OK'
click 'Add JARs...'

Navigate to the /lib directory and select all the .jar files in that
directory and click 'Open'

click 'OK' and Eclipse will rebuild your projects and now it has the 
dependencies to link to you should see all the Problems disappear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
++ RUNNING BRAINFARM - STANDALONE JAVA APPLICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running from the Command Line.

Open a terminal window (mac) or command prompt (win) and from the root of 
your brainfarm directory cd into the /gui directory and run

ant java-launch

This will run the Java Application for you.

2. Running from within Eclipse

Expand the /src directory of the 'gui' project, right-click on the class

org.brainfarm.java.gui.MainGui

and select Run As -> Java Application.
