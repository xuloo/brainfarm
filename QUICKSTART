++ Quick Guide to using brainfarm
++ Currently only covering the Java Gui as that's all there is!
++ =======================================================================

Follow the instructions in the README for building brainfarm and running the Java GUI.

When the Java Gui starts click the 

'Load Default Parameters' 

button. This will load the default settings in and initialize the Neat context that experiments will use.

Now, click on the 

'Session Parameters'

tab and click

'Load Session File…'

button. This will bring up a file dialog. To load an experiment you must load the JAR that contains the experiment's files.

To load the example XOR project navigate to

${brainfarm.root}/experiments/xor/bin/dist

and load the 

xor-experiment.jar 

file that's in the directory when brainfarm has been built.

This will set up the Java Application ready to run the xor experiment in the context you created in the previous step.

Click the 'Generation' Tab and click the 'start' button to begin the experiment.

When the experiment is loaded you'll see an 'experiment' directory created under the 

${brainfarm.root}/gui 

directory. This 'experiment' directory contains all the files extracted from the experiment JAR.

When the experiment is running you'll see the population data being written into the /result directory - this provides you with all the data for all organisms/species/populations/epochs generated by the experiment as Spring context files - they can be loaded and analyzed when the experiment is complete.
